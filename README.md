# Better Call Saul Kart

- This repo contains a full decompilation of Better Call Saul Kart.
- Naming and documentation of the source code and data structures will probably never exist.

It builds the following executable and its required assets:

* Better Call Saul Kart.exe `sha1: idk`

This repo does include all assets necessary for compiling the game.
A prior copy of the game is **NOT** required to extract the assets.

## Installation

Clone the repo to wherever and load it with Unity 2020.3.40f1.
**Keep in mind the original game was built using Unity 2020.3.38 instead, but I've updated it as the one I've used was the latest LTS release of that version.

#### Build

To build, clone this repo into your local Unity install filesystem and build the game with Unity.

## Project Structure
	
	idk it's a unity project it's the same as the rest

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to
discuss what you would like to change.

Honestly if you wanna make a modding repo or whatever I'd recommend using a fork instead as I intend to make this repo stay as faithful to the orig as possible (aside from bug-fixes ig).

Official Discord: there's none lmao
