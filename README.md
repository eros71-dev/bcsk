# Better Call Saul Kart

- This repo contains a full decompilation of Better Call Saul Kart.
- Naming and documentation of the source code and data structures will probably never exist.

In theory, this should make a gameplay and visually-wise identical (probably not matching though) build.

This repo does include all assets necessary for compiling the game.
A prior copy of the game is not required to extract the assets.

AssetRipper was used for the decompilation of this project, and the required Unity packages have been installed in order for the game to work.

## Installation

Clone the repo to wherever and load it with Unity 2020.3.40f1.
**Keep in mind the original game was built using Unity 2020.3.38 instead, but I've updated it as the one I've used was the latest LTS release of that version at the time this decomp was started.

#### Build

To build, clone this repo into your local Unity install filesystem and build the game with Unity.
